The datasets in this directories provide the volume of each post-PCR, cleaned
library to be used for generating equimolar dlibrary dilutions. These dilutions
can then be pooled in equal volumes to generate equimolar pools for sequencing.
These datasets were generated using the script in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ness-lab/illumina-pooling/blob/master/scripts/illumina-pooling.R)
