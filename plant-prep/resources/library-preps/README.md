The datasets in this directory were used while setting up the library preps
for the Toronto plants. They contain extraction QC data, as well as a random
selection of plants meeting QC standards to be used in the library preps.

Note that [05_allPlants_toPrep_randomized.csv](05_allPlants_toPrep_randomized.csv) was generated by randomly
rearranging the rows of [04_allPlants_toPrep.csv](04_allPlants_toPrep.csv)
in Excel
